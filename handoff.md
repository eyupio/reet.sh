# AI agent setup handoff

## Goal and agreed scope

Expand reet from skills management to portable AI agent setups. The first
milestone is complete backup and restore of supported setups on a new machine;
profile sync follows, then reviewed updates/diagnostics/rollback.

The authoritative detailed plan is [docs/agent-setup-plan.md](docs/agent-setup-plan.md).
It records the owner's decisions, architecture, delivery slices, acceptance gates,
validation and compatibility constraints. Do not reopen settled choices without
new evidence.

Key choices: broad popular-agent discovery (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi and
others); explicit verified support/gaps; standalone local CLI; local preview and
confirmation; verified cross-OS restore; exact recorded versions; per-conflict
choices and rollback copies; reusable memory included; history opt-in; portable
credentials optionally encrypted with a user-held key/passphrase; local encrypted
storage plus optional S3; named profiles with machine/project overrides.

## Branch and baseline

- Branch: `feat/agent-setup-backup-plan`.
- Base: `origin/main` at `3fd9e2c` (includes controller skill sync, PR #38).
- Existing skill scan/sync, hosted MCP, lifecycle and backup behaviour must remain
  compatible. Hosted MCP access is distinct from managing installed MCP servers.
- No implementation capability is implied by this planning document.

## Progress

- [x] Inspect existing scanner, CLI, backup primitives and repository guidance.
- [x] Write the detailed plan and this handoff.
- [x] Open a draft PR containing the plan before beginning implementation: [#39](https://github.com/eyupio/reet.sh/pull/39).
- [x] Implement S0: local agent discovery and capability reporting.
- [x] Add fixtures and CLI tests; update README with actual commands/limitations.
- [x] Run required checks and record results below.

## Implemented slice

`internal/setup` and `reet setup scan [--json] [--project PATH]` now provide
metadata-only path discovery and executable lookup without executing agents
or reading configuration contents. Six declarative adapters cover Claude Code,
Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Cursor and Gemini CLI. Schema v1 reports explicit observation
states and backup/restore as not implemented. Shared files do not establish that
an agent is installed. Optional path overrides and explicit project scope are
covered by tests. Details: [setup discovery](docs/setup-discovery.md).

## Next implementation task

No setup backup/restore command is implemented in this slice. The next task after
S0 is typed component inventory and secret classification (S1), before collecting
file contents into archives. Do not generically copy agent configuration trees:
they may mix secrets, session history, caches and executable hooks.

Start S1 with fixture-backed parsing of the named agents' settings and MCP
declarations. Add bounded file reads, component provenance, secret-reference
classification and explicit partial-read diagnostics. Keep raw secret values out
of inventory JSON. Document formats/versions actually tested and unsupported
fields. Only then define archive selection and collection contracts for S2.

## Validation and continuation

Repository guidance is in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; no AGENTS.md was found in the
workspace during initial inspection. Required commands:

```sh
cd web && npm run check
cd .. && go vet ./... && go test -race ./...
```

This workspace has toolchains in `/workspace/.reet-tools/activate.sh`; source it
before local Go/Node commands. This is a workspace convenience, not a product
runtime requirement. Network commands may require sandbox network permission.

Validation completed on Linux on 22 October 2026:

- `go test ./internal/setup` and `go test -race ./internal/setup`: passed.
- `go vet ./...`: passed.
- `go test -race ./...`: passed across all packages.
- `npm run check` in `web/`: 8 tests passed; Svelte reported zero errors/warnings.
- `npm ci && npm test` in `mcp/`: 14 tests passed, including OAuth and real API tests.
- `go build -o /tmp/reet-setup-discovery ./cmd/reet`: passed.
- Compiled CLI smoke test with temporary home/project: JSON/text/help, explicit
  project scope, omitted synthetic secret, unchanged configuration and rejection
  of the unimplemented restore command all passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

Initial checks needed the existing Go/MCP dependencies downloaded with sandbox
network access; reruns then passed. No dependency or lockfile changes were made.
No macOS/Windows runtime or cross-OS restore verification has been performed.
The PR remains a draft for the broader initiative; S0 is implemented and tested.
